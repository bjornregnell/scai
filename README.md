# Play with Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Have you ever wondered how AI works? 

Here you find an example of a very simple AI in the form of a small neural network implemented in the beginner-friendly Scala programming language. 

* This AI has 6 neurons with in total 20 parameters that are adjusted during training on 4 data points. 
* A smart AI such as ChatGPT has more than 100 million parameters and is trained on really big data...
